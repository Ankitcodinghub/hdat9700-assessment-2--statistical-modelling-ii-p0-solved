Assessment 2 Instructions

Overview

For your final assessment you are required to prepare a short analysis report applying one of the statistical techniques covered in the course. The report should be presented in IMRD (Introduction/Methods/Results/Discussion) format and should be approximately 1500 words.

Topic options

You can base your report on one of the following three options:

Interrupted time series Evaluating the effect of media coverage following publication of new drug safety research on dispensing of oral contraceptives using time series data

A dataset is supplied for each option. A more detailed description of each option is provided at the end of this document.

Report structure

Your report should be presented in IMRD format and be approximately 1500 words long. The word count does not include tables, figures, footnotes, references, appendices, or the student declaration. You should include up to five tables/figures in the main body of the report, with supplementary tables/figures included in the appendix.

Below is in an example of how you might lay out your report:

1. Student declaration

2. Introduction (200-300 words approx.)

3. Methods (550-650 words approx.)

4. Results (350-450 words approx.)

5. Discussion (200-300 words approx.)

6. References (As appropriate)

7. Appendix (As appropriate)

8. Student declaration

Introduction

200-300 words approx.

The introduction section should provide some brief background information on the research area and motivate why the research question is of scientific interest. Because you have been presented with a research topic you do not need to make this section very detailed, you should simply demonstrate that you have understood the relevance of the research question, and make the connections between the research question, the available data and the analytic approach.

Methods

550-650 words approx.

In the methods section you should describe in detail the analyses that were undertaken, and why. It is important that you demonstrate that you understand the rationale for applying a particular statistical technique and/or any alternative model specifications/model diagnostics. You should demonstrate your understanding of the statistical methods with appropriate references to the literature.

Results

350-450 words approx.

In the results section you should begin with a descriptive overview of the dataset you have used, including summaries of any key variables. Follow this with a summary of your analysis results using appropriate tables and figures, as well as describing your main results in text. Appropriate model diagnostics and/or alternative model specifications should be included but can be presented in the appendix if they are lengthy.

DiscussionAssignment Project Exam Help

200-300 words approx.

Your report should include 5-10 appropriate references to the literature, with a full list of references provided in the references section. You can use your preferred referencing style. More information on academic referencing can be found on the UNSW website: https://student.unsw.edu.au/referencing

Appendix

The appendix should include any supplementary material that does not fit in the body of the report, for example additional descriptive tables or model diagnostics plots.

Your assessment will be marked according to the marking rubric on the following page. Four criteria are assessed: ‚Ä¢

Conceptual understanding (30%) ‚Ä¢ Application of statistical method (30%) ‚Ä¢ Interpretation (30%) ‚Ä¢ Presentation (10%) 6.

Option 1: Causal inference via matching

Overview

Research question

Data

The data for this assessment are drawn from the National Children‚Äôs Study Archive. The National Children‚Äôs Study (NCS) Assignment Project Exam Help

collected birth and early childhood data on more than 5,000 children and their families in the USA from 2009-2014. The NCS teaching database contains base child-level data, as well as several topic-specific modules.

The following resources will be useful to help understand the data: * Information on the National Children‚Äôs Study Archive *

Option 2: Interrupted time series analysis

Overview

Oral contraceptives (‚Äúbirth control pills‚Äù) are taken by women to prevent pregnancy and to treat other conditions such as endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome. There are two main types of oral contraceptive pills, the most common being the combined pill, which contains a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progestogen in various formulations and doses. The second type is the progestogen-only pill (also called the ‚Äúmini pill‚Äù) that contains only progestogen.

In this assessment you will use time series data to explore the impact of the media attention surrounding the publication of this study on the PBS-subsidised dispensing of combined and progestogen-only oral contraceptives. In Australia, combined contraceptive pills containing levonorgestrel/ethinylestradiol, norethisterone/ethinylestradiol and norethisterone/mestranol are subsidised through the PBS. Other combined pill formulations are not subsidised, such as those containing drosperinone, cyproterone and desogestrel and are not captured in the data. Several progestogen-only mini pills are also subsidised, including levonorgestrel and norethisterone.

Research question

What was the impact of the media attention around the increased risk of thrombosis associated with oral contraceptive use on dispensing of combined oral contraceptives?

Data Assignment Project Exam Help

there was a change in combined oral contraceptive dispensing following the media attention. * Plot the predicted counterfactual to visualise any change in dispensing following the media attention. * Use the ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù series (dispensing of progestogen-only oral contraceptives) and comment on the findings in relation to those from the combined pill series.

Option 3: Longitudinal multilevel modelling

Overview

Children‚Äôs growth is frequently monitored during their infancy and understanding growth trajectories is important for identification of chronic disorders or other health issues, reassuring parents and providing information on the health of a nation‚Äôs children.

In this assignment you will use data including repeated measurements of children‚Äôs weight to model children‚Äôs weight change over time. The data also include information on other infant, environmental and maternal factors, and you will also explore which of them could further improve the model for children‚Äôs weight gain. You should use the nlme package in R for carrying out your longitudinal multilevel modelling.

Research question

What is the optimal longitudinal multilevel model for modelling children‚Äôs weight change?

Data

The data for this assessment are drawn from the National Children‚Äôs Study Archive. The National Children‚Äôs Study (NCS) collected birth and early childhood data on more than 5,000 children and their families in the USA from 2009-2014. The NCS teaching database contains base child-level data, as well as several topic-specific modules.

You are provided with a dataset named ncs_child_repeated.csv. This file contains information on child, mother and household demographics for 4,531 kids, with 1-4 weight observations for each child (12,654 observations overall). The data are drawn from the NCS base Child dataset, and the Child health module, including children‚Äôs weight measurements at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months after their birth. Some data preparation has already taken place, in particular, the above files have been merged, only singleton births and the oldest siblings have been included (i.e. only one child per mother), and variables with high proportions of missing data have been removed.

The following resources will be useful to help understand the data: * Information on the National Children‚Äôs Study Archive *

NCS study description and guide * Codebook for the base Child data * Codebook for the Child Health module

Hints Assignment Project Exam Help

‚Ä¢ Conduct appropriate EDA to understand the relationship between weight and age.

‚Ä¢ There is only one child per mother, and thus you do not need to include mother as an additional level in your multilevel modelling.

‚Ä¢ Explore alternative functions of time to improve model fit.

‚Ä¢ Explore other covariates that help to explain variation in children‚Äôs weight.

‚Ä¢ Some child health variables (e.g. gastro, diarrhoea, ear_infection) were not measured on every visit occasion, so if these are included you will need to think about how to handle that.
